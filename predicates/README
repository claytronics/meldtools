Dependencies:
	- Boost
		- MPI (optional)
		- Threads
   - libreadline
	- A compiler
		G++ 4.4/4.2, maybe 4.6
		LLVM/Clang also works

Installation:
	- Run boostrap.sh: sh ./bootstrap.sh
	- Type make: make

Execution:
	./meld -f bytecodefile -c scheduler
	Use ./meld -h for help

Directories:
   - db: implements the database, including facts (tuples) and nodes
   - external: implements the available external functions (callable in meld programs)
   - mem: memory allocator for objects used during execution. This improves multithreaded performance since the default allocator is sequential.
   - process: the machine class starts the execution of the virtual machine (program argument, scheduler type and number of threads). There are also MPI management classes.
   - queue: many types of queues here, including priority queues. It's all template code.
   - runtime: classes for list and string objects used for meld objects.
   - sched: sched::base is the base class for all the available schedulers.
      A scheduler implements a way of executing meld. The simplest scheduler is sched/serial for sequential execution.
   - stat: code for generating execution statistics.
   - thread: multithreaded schedulers.
   - ui: manages communication with browser interface.
   - utils: utilities.
   - vm: the core of the virtual machine, executes VM instructions.

Important files:
   - meld.cpp: main meld program.
   - server.cpp: server program for using the web interface.
